### This is the link of video 
[Petros vrellis Starry night interactive animation (2012)](http://artof01.com/vrellis/works/starry_night.html) 

- This is a large interactive installation that The viewer is further engaged by interacting with the painting; almost infinite variations can occur, as the flows are driven by his hand. 

- In this artwork, I want to combine two aspects in my project, one is infinite variation or rotation of the line, another is user interaction. 

- Generallly speaking, when the user uses the mouse or touches the screen, the elements on the screen change in real time

- Benefits: The flow of elements in the screen can make the project more vivid and interesting, and the interaction between the user and the project can increase the interactivity and make the user more immersive

## Coding Technique Exploration

1. (In this step, I want to use the for loop in my project which means each stroke of an item can be represented by a particle object, when the user press the mouse, they can influence the particle swarm, and changes can occur to generate new strokes around the mouse randomly.)
```
function draw() {
    if (!mouseIsPressed) {
        mouseX = noise(frameCount / 100) * width;
        mouseY = noise(frameCount / 100 + 100) * height;
    }
    for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        for (let part of particles) {
            part.action();
        }
    }
    if (frameRate() > 50) {
        particles.push(new p());
    }
    for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        if (particles[int(random(100))].lt > 200) {
            particles[int(random(100))].pos = createVector(mouseX + random(-50, 50), mouseY + random(-50, 50));
            particles[int(random(100))].lt = 0;
        }
    }
}
```

2. (In this step, I want to use spacebar to control the animation of the project, users can pause or keep the animation going.) 
```
function keyPressed() {
    if (keyCode == 32) {
        if (o == 1) {
            noLoop();
            o = 0;
        } else {
            loop();
            o = 1;
        }
    }
}
```

3. (In thhis step, I want to use the class method to change the every position of the stroke by setting perlin noise to generate the new stroke in my project, color of the stroke by setting random value of the alpha, and use boundary checking to help me control the every stroke within a defined area.) 

```
class p {
    constructor() {
        this.pos = createVector(random(0, width), random(0, height));
        this.alpha = random(-50, 50);
        this.lt = 0;
    }
    action() {
        let a = noise(this.pos.x / noiseScale, this.pos.y / noiseScale) * 2 * PI * noiseScale;
        this.pos.x += cos(a) * speed;
        this.pos.y += sin(a) * speed;
        if (this.pos.x < 0 || this.pos.x > width || this.pos.y < 0 || this.pos.y > height) {
            this.pos = createVector(random(0, width), random(0, height));
            this.alpha = random(-50, 50);
        }
        let c = img.get(int(this.pos.x), int(this.pos.y));
        fill(red(c) + this.alpha, green(c) + this.alpha, blue(c) + this.alpha);
        ellipse(this.pos.x, this.pos.y, 5);
        this.lt++;
    }
}
```

4. Overall: 
I think this code example is similar in style to the art installationï¼Œ and it can be applied to my project. I want the lines or patterns in the project to move based on Perlin noise and change colour based on the underlying image. The lines or patterns can be remade and changed to create a continuous visual effect, and the user can pause and resume the animation using the space bar.
