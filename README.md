### This is the link of video 
[Petros vrellis Starry night interactive animation (2012)](http://artof01.com/vrellis/works/starry_night.html) 

- This is a large interactive installation that The viewer is further engaged by interacting with the painting; almost infinite variations can occur, as the flows are driven by his hand. The background ambient music is also responsive, making the experience even more intense.

- In this artwork, I want to combine two aspects in my project, one is infinite variation or rotation of the line, another is user interaction. 

- Generallly speaking, when the user uses the mouse or touches the screen, the elements on the screen change in real time
